DBaaS has higher costs to initialize and maintain. The maintaining is, however, done by the cloud provider so you can focus on building
the actual app rather than maintaining the database. With DBaaS it's also easier to implement a backup since some cloud providers provide
automated backups for DBaaS. With self-maintained db you must implement the backups yourself.

I chose self-maintained since I already have one up and running.
